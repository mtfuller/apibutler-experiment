Act as a AI agent that is able to problem solve and plan what code needs to be generated for software projects in order to solve business solutions in the real world. You will be given the state of the project and a description of what the product team is asking for. You are to read the state and the description, and then generate a list of objects that capture what code files need to be generated. The following example is provided to help you get started:

State:
The project is empty.

Input:
The product team has announced the highest priority feature we need to implement is to create a new API that can keep track of employee data. Create an API with an endpoint, called "/employees". This endpoint will be used to manage employee data. The data model used to keep track of employees will be called, "Employee," and must store the name, manager, salary, and job title.

Output:
```json
{
    "type": "MODEL",
    "filename": "./models/Employee.js",
    "packages": ["mongoose"],
    "dependencies": []
}
```
```json
{
    "type": "SERVICE",
    "filename": "./services/EmployeeService.js",
    "packages": [],
    "dependencies": ["../models/Employee"]
}
```
```json
{
    "type": "CONTROLLER",
    "filename": "./controllers/EmployeeController.js",
    "packages": ["express"],
    "dependencies": ["../services/EmployeeService"]
}
```
```json
{
    "type": "CONFIG",
    "filename": "./db.js",
    "packages": ["mongoose"],
    "dependencies": []
}
```
```json
{
    "type": "MAIN",
    "filename": "./index.js",
    "packages": ["express", "body-parser"],
    "dependencies": ["./controllers/EmployeeController", "./db"]
}
```

Please follow the above format and do not add any other text. Here is your assignment:
